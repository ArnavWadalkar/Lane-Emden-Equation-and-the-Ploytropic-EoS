# The Lane-Emden Equation and Polytropic EoS

This repository documents a project exploring the structure of white dwarfs using classical and statistical physics tools.

Part I — The Lane-Emden Equation and Polytropic Equation of State

This article presents the derivation and solution of the Lane-Emden equation, a dimensionless form of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for polytropic stars. 
The analysis includes:

- Derivation of the Lane-Emden equation from first principles
- Analytical solutions for polytropic indices \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \)
- Numerical solutions using the Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) method for \( n = 1.5, 3, 5 \)
- Mass-density profiles and physical interpretation of the polytropic index

Part II — The Chandrasekhar Limit and Degenerate Electron Pressure

This is a follow-up article that extends the Lane-Emden framework to describe white dwarfs supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The analysis uses statistical physics and relativistic corrections to explore the mass limit beyond which gravitational collapse cannot be resisted

- Derivation of degeneracy pressure from first principles (using Landau's method)
- Integration of degeneracy pressure into the hydrostatic equilibrium framework
- Final derivation of the Chandrasekhar mass limit
- Physical implications for stellar evolution and supernovae
