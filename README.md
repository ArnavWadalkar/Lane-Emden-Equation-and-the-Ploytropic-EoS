# The Lane-Emden Equation and Polytropic EoS

This repository documents aproject exploring the structure of white dwarfs using classical and statistical physics tools.

This article presents the derivation and solution of the Lane-Emden equation, a dimensionless form of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for polytropic stars. 
The analysis includes:

- Derivation of the Lane-Emden equation from first principles
- Analytical solutions for polytropic indices \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \)
- Numerical solutions using the Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) method for \( n = 1.5, 3, 5 \)
- Mass-density profiles and physical interpretation of the polytropic index
